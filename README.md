Hello Everyone,
My name is Ray Camacho, I am currently studying Computer Science at Saint Leo University. I am a junior set to graduate Spring of 2023. I also am a part of the baseball team here at Saint Leo as I came to this school with a very serious intention of playing baseball at the next level. I am really enjoying studying computer science and can not wait to see what type of jobs I can find in the future of this amazing degree.
Thank You
Ray Camacho
